"""Earned-rung tally (box audit willow-gate B12).

pass_count / fail_count are in the agent's own HMAC-signed header, so an agent
registered for Elder could put pass_count=999 in its FIRST header and clear the
min_pass_count=50 threshold instantly — the rungs were self-certified. The gate
now accrues its own per-agent count from witnessed check-outs (capped by the
tools it authorized) and, under WILLOW_GATE_ENFORCE_EARNED_RUNGS, gates on that.
