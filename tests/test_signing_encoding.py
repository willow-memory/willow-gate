"""Canonical signing-encoding golden vector (box audit A6).

Four repos hand-rolled the HMAC signing message; one (Nestor) used a naive
``"\\x1f".join(...)`` that was forgeable, while willow-gate / willow-mcp
session_binder / the-squirrel used the collision-safe canonical JSON. They now
all use the canonical form. This test pins the EXACT bytes so willow-gate can't
drift; willow-mcp/tests/test_signing_encoding.py pins the SAME golden, so the two
independent copies (session_binder deliberately does not depend on willow-gate)
are held byte-identical — the divergence that caused the forgery can't recur.

If this vector changes, the signing encoding changed: every other copy's golden
must change in lockstep, and every already-signed header/session is invalidated.
