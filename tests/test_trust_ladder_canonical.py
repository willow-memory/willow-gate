"""A9 — the fleet trust ladder is ONE canonical identity->authority model.

The 2026-07-24 box scan (A9) flagged the trust model living in three
incompatible shapes: willow-gate's rich ``TrustLevel`` ladder (here),
willow-mcp's ``session_binder.TRUST_LEVELS`` ``(name, read_only)``, and
willow-mcp's ``tier_policy`` tool-class ceiling. Nothing cross-checks them, so
they can silently disagree — and then an agent's authority depends on *which*
gate evaluates it (a "Rookie" on this ladder that is ``full_access`` in a
manifest is exactly the hole willow-mcp's tier_policy closes at enforcement).

They express the SAME ladder today. This pins THIS repo's ladder to the
canonical below; willow-mcp pins the *identical* canonical in its own
``tests/test_trust_ladder_canonical.py``. If either repo's ladder drifts from
the canonical, its test fails loudly — the same golden-vector discipline the A6
signing-encoding guard uses across the two repos (they can't share code:
``session_binder`` deliberately does not import willow-gate).

Canonical: ``level -> (name, read_only, cumulative privilege classes)``.
``query`` is a read-synonym fleet-wide (willow-mcp tier_policy documents that no
capability is "query but not read"), so it is folded into ``read`` before
comparison. Privilege is cumulative: read ⊆ +write(Steady) ⊆ +execute(Veteran)
⊆ +admin(Elder); Exiled/Rookie are read-only.
