# willow-gate

A minimalist check-in / check-out gate for agents. Symmetric 13-field
validation, a five-rung trust ladder, an announce-loud-for-the-untrusted
inversion, and a PGP-encrypted flat-file ledger. Hard stops, no swallowed
exceptions.

From the WillowGate DRAFT_SPEC (v0314), hardened and verified.

## The idea

Every agent knocks on the door with the same 13 fields going in and 13 coming
out. What it declares on entry is reconciled against what it actually did on
exit. Trust is not *asserted* — it is **bound**: the `signature` field is an
HMAC over the header keyed by a per-agent secret the gate holds, and a claimed
`trust_level` is capped at the agent's registered ceiling. "Elder" is not a
text field anyone can type.

Read is universal — but for a true outsider it is *not gate-mediated*. Exiled
(level 0) is **refused a session at check-in** (`entry_allowed=False`); it is the
one level that may not enter. An outsider still reads, loudly, by a path the gate
never claimed to mediate — what it cannot do is *take information anywhere else*:
export/exfiltration is gated, and the lower the trust, the louder every action is
announced. A session-bearing read is a Rookie+ affair.

## Trust levels

| Level | Name | Session | Export | Announcement | Tools |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | Exiled | **none — refused at check-in** | ❌ | maximum | read (session-less) |
| 1 | Rookie | read-only | ❌ | large | read |
| 2 | Steady | read + write | ✅ | medium | read, write |
| 3 | Veteran | read + write | ✅ | small | + query, execute |
| 4 | Elder | read + write | ✅ | minimal | + admin |

Drift and fail budgets **tighten** as trust rises — the most powerful rung is
held to the strictest tolerances, not the loosest.

## Enforcement vs. audit — read this first

WillowGate **prevents** only when a harness routes every tool call through
`authorize_tool()` *before* the tool runs. Wired into a pre-tool hook it is a
gate: a denied call never executes. Un-wired, it is a loud **ledger** — it
records and announces, but cannot stop what it is never asked about.

`gate.bind_tools(session, tools)` is that harness, in-process: it returns a
`GatedSession` holding the tool callables privately, so `call()` — which
authorizes *before* invoking and hard-stops a denied call — is the only path to
a tool. There is no un-gated way to reach the function, so "route every call
through the gate" stops being a convention you have to remember. Because only
authorized calls are ever recorded as used, `check_out`'s reconciliation stays
true for free. Use `bind_tools` for the in-process case; use the raw
`authorize_tool` when you are wiring your own external pre-tool hook.

The identity binding is **symmetric** (HMAC — the gate holds each agent's
secret). Asymmetric "agent signs, gate verifies with only a public key" needs
the `signature` field widened beyond 64 hex.

## Sibling module: the friction floor

`willow_gate.friction_floor` watches a different surface. WillowGate gates
*access* — who may do what. The friction floor watches the *relationship* —
whether an agent has stopped being **other** and started reflecting the user
back, smoothed, while the user is escalating. It is a deterministic, model-free
**smoke detector**: it raises a loud flag for a human, it never blocks, and it
must run *outside* the model it watches, because a mirror can't audit itself.
It flags sustained low friction (no pushback, no outside grounding, mostly echo)
during a ramp — and fails loud, not open. See the module docstring; `pytest`
pins the behavior.

## Install

```bash
pip install -e .        # python-gnupg is required for the encrypted ledger
```

Deploying for real use needs `/willowgate` provisioned first — the gate's
security properties rest on filesystem permissions the code does not set itself,
and the choice between in-process and supervisor topology decides whether the
earned-rung protection holds at all. See
[`docs/deployment-runbook.md`](docs/deployment-runbook.md).

## Quickstart

```python
from willow_gate import WillowGate

# Ledger encrypts to the operator's PGP key — never a bundled key.
gate = WillowGate(operator_key_fpr="<your PGP fingerprint>")

# Bind an identity to a shared secret and a trust CEILING. Operator-side only.
gate.register_agent("R1", secret=b"...32+ bytes...", max_trust=1)

ok, msg, session = gate.check_in(header)                 # 13 fields, HMAC-signed

# Prevention harness: the tools are only reachable through the gate.
from willow_gate import Tool
room = gate.bind_tools(session, [
    Tool("read", read_fn),
    Tool("write", write_fn),
    Tool("send", send_fn, export=True),                  # exfiltrates -> export-gated
])
page = room.call("read")                                 # authorized, then runs
# room.call("write") for a read-only level -> GateError, write_fn never runs

ok, msg = gate.check_out(session, exit_header)            # 13 fields, diffed
```

Prefer `room.call(...)` when WillowGate is in-process: a denied tool never
runs, and you never have to remember to call `authorize_tool` first. Drop to
the raw `gate.authorize_tool(session, "read")` only when you are wiring an
external pre-tool hook yourself.

For local logic testing without PGP, pass `require_pgp=False` — this writes a
plaintext ledger and is for development only, never production. Pair it with
`base_dir=` so it does not try to create `/willowgate`; the default base dir is
absolute by design (see the runbook).

## Tests

```bash
pip install -e '.[dev]'
pytest
```

Covers trust binding, the registered ceiling cap, inline `authorize_tool`
prevention, export denial, nonce replay (including across a restart, via the
persistent nonce store), the reserved trap field, drift limits, the
Exiled entry-refusal (`entry_allowed`), and symmetric check-out. A separate
PGP round-trip test (skipped if `gpg`/`python-gnupg` are unavailable) proves the
encrypted ledger encrypts and decrypts.
