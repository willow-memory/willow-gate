"""custody.py — the custody ledger, Tier 1: the spine.

An append-only, hash-chained event log. It is the trust root that a handled file
cannot rewrite: the file carries only a fingerprint stamp; the truth lives here,
where the thing being tracked can't reach it. Same rule as the friction floor and
the fingerprint check — the lock lives outside the thing it locks.

This module is Tier 1 of `docs/custody-ledger-spec.md` and nothing more. It gives
you four properties, each with a test that proves it:

  * APPEND-ONLY by construction. There is no update() and no delete(). The only
    write is append(); the history cannot be edited through this API.
  * HASH-CHAINED. Every event carries the hash of the one before it, so an
    IN-PLACE alteration of any past event breaks verification of every event
    after it. NOTE the boundary: an attacker who rewrites a past event AND
    re-derives every subsequent ledger_prev_hash produces a self-consistent
    chain that verify() accepts, and a tail-truncation also passes — nothing here
    pins the head. Detecting those requires the Tier-4 checkpoint signature that
    commits the head externally. Tier 1 gives tamper-detection for in-place
    edits; Tier 4 gives tamper-evidence for the whole chain.
  * CANONICAL. Hashes are computed over a byte-stable canonical form (sorted
    keys, compact, UTF-8, nulls omitted). Reordering input keys cannot change a
    hash — otherwise the chain and any future signature would be meaningless.
  * FAIL-CLOSED on secrets. append() refuses any event carrying a value that
    looks like a live credential and writes nothing. A gate crossing is recorded
    as having happened under a credential *id*, never with the credential.

Honest limits, stated up front because the rule is don't overclaim:

  * It WITNESSES, it does not PREVENT. Nothing here stops a file being edited by
    something that emits no event; later tiers only *detect* that (a hash jump
    with no explaining event). Tier 1 is just the trustworthy log.
  * Redaction is pattern-based and therefore incomplete. It uses specific,
    high-confidence credential shapes on purpose — it deliberately does NOT flag
    generic long/hex strings, because those are exactly what content hashes look
    like, and a redactor that ate its own chain fields would be worse than none.
    It fails closed on what it recognizes; extend the patterns, never loosen the
    default.
  * A signed/verified chain proves provenance and integrity, not truth. A
    faithfully recorded false statement is still false.

Signing (PGP checkpoints) is Tier 4 and is not here. Session check-in/check-out
reconciliation (H5) is Tier 2 and is not here. This is the spine only.

# --- Tier 3: file custody (lineage, diffs, capture-gap detection) ------------
# Every file has a stable lineage_id that survives content changes; each version
# links to its parent by content hash, so the whole life of a file is queryable
# and diffable. The ledger WITNESSES, it does not PREVENT: an edit made by
# something that emits no event is not blocked — it is DETECTED. The next
# observed content hash will not match the last recorded one, and
# detect_capture_gap() writes a capture_gap. Detection is the value; it is not a
# wall. (The actual wiring into a pre-tool hook / egress lane is cross-repo
# Tier 3b; this is the standalone core those hooks call.)
#
# LAUNDERING LIMIT (honest): detect_capture_gap only fires when an honest
# observer reports a hash BEFORE a write is recorded. An actor who controls the
# write path can record an out-of-band edit as a normal file_write (auto-parent =
# last recorded hash); verify_lineage passes and no gap is raised. This detects
# accidents and honest reporting, not an adversary who owns the recorder — for
# that you need the write path itself to run through the gate (Tier 3b) and the
# H5 reconciliation to catch the undeclared capability.
