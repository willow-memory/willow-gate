"""WillowGate — hardened build (from DRAFT_SPEC v0314).

Your design, kept intact: symmetric 13-field check-in / check-out, five trust
levels, PGP-encrypted flat-file ledger, the reserved trap field, hard stops,
and the announce-loud-for-the-untrusted inversion.

Strengthenings applied over the draft — each is one of the review points, and
each is marked `# HARDENED` at its site so you can find and judge it:

  1. PREVENT, not just detect. `authorize_tool()` is an INLINE pre-tool gate
     that refuses a disallowed tool or export in real time. `check_out()` still
     diffs as defense-in-depth — but the lock is now at the door, not the exit.
  2. Trust is BOUND, not self-reported. The 64-hex `signature` field is a real
     HMAC-SHA256 over the canonical header, keyed by a per-agent secret the gate
     holds (registered out-of-band). A claimed `trust_level` is capped at the
     agent's registered `max_trust`. An agent cannot mint trust it wasn't granted
     — "Elder" stops being a text field anyone can type.
  3. No bundled PRIVATE key. The ledger encrypts to the operator's key; nothing
     shipped can decrypt it. A public key may ship for verify/encrypt-to-gate;
     the private half never does.
  4. Replay-proof nonce. Used nonces persist to disk, so a restart can't forget
     them and let a token be replayed.
  5. `blast_radius` -> `announcement_volume`. It means audit loudness — the
     inverse of the standard term (where minimizing blast radius is the goal).
     The rename stops the misread.
  6. The Exiled contradiction is resolved (willow-gate#12). `entry_allowed` gates
     session CREATION: Exiled (level 0) is REFUSED at check_in and holds no
     session — that is what makes it distinct from Rookie (both are otherwise
     read-only). Read is still universal, but for a true outsider it is not
     gate-mediated: an outsider never checks in, so a session-bearing read is a
     Rookie+ affair and an outsider reads by a path the gate never mediated.
  7. Tolerance no longer rewards power with slack. drift/fail budgets TIGHTEN as
     trust rises (Elder is held tightest), the reverse of the draft. This is a
     constant table — revert it if you meant it the other way.

VERIFIED: 13 logic tests + a PGP encrypted-ledger round-trip pass (see
tests/). Two bugs were found and fixed by running it — read was universal in
the docstring but not the code, and the write flag keyed off the wrong axis.
The rule held: test before you trust, and this file was no exception.
